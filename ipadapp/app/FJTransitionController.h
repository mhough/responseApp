// This class allows you to load arbitrary view controllers and animate view transitions
// It currently supports 5 types of animations provided by the excellent FTUtils
//
// It is a full replacement for UINavigationController or UItabBarController
//
// It provides your VCs all proper viewDid/WillAppear and viewDid/WillDisapear messages
// WITH proper timing (Using bits and pieces of code from SDNextRUnloopProxy)
//
// It depends on another open source projects, FTUtils
//

 Use these 3 methods to add view controllers to the Transition Controller
 
 Setting the VCs using Class/Nibs is better for memory as the View Controllers won't be instantiated until needed …AND they can be re-instantiated as well. Sweet!
 
 If You also need a navigation controller for drill down. Pass YES for useNavigationController for the VCs you wish to have "wrapped" in a navigation controller. The rest happens automagically.
